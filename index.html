  <h3>Content Element 1</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Communication #1
   comunnication is key if you cant talk about a conflict or a little issue you're having with a person 
   you need to work on that
   dont ghost them 
   dont give them the silent treatment 
   dont bottle everything up and blow up on them
    instead you should
    comunicate that you just need a break, maybe because you are mad at them and need to process your emotions or just because 
    sechudule a time to talk, maybe in person or a facetime call
