  <h1>My Unofficial Local Guide on how to paint a portait like a pro!!!!</h1>
  
  <h3>underpainting</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>start your underpainting 
   your underpainting doesnt have to be perfect!!!!!!<br>
   its just a layer of paint that acts like a map <br>
   thats going to determne where things are going to be
   1. choose one color for this process, I rec using
   monochromatic earth tones like burnt sienna or raw umber,<br> 
   or complementary colors such as blue and orange to create contrast and vibrancy<br>
   2. apply a thin layer of your paint over the entire canvas <br>
   3. establish your values and compostion <br>
   4.after completing this first step, i suggest you let the paint dry a little<br>
  bit before starting to add more layers especially if your working with oil<br>

  <h3>mix your colors</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>color mixing
    beore you go any further, its best to have your color pallete laid out in front of you 
    plan out your colors 
    mix them and make sure to mix a genurous amount of paint so you dont have to go pack and mix more paint
